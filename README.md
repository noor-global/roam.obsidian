$$ {\large Reflection.Operation.Asset.Museum }$$

A personal knowledge management and operating system built in Obsidian.

## 🏛️ The Four Pillars

- **Reflection**: A dedicated space for daily journaling and building a personal wiki to capture long-term insights.
- **Operation**: The engine for active tasks, events, and project-based operations to drive productivity.
- **Asset**: A central repository for curated resources, attachments, and foundational databases.
- **Museum**: The architectural core containing vault configurations, templates, and curated collections.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This vault is designed with a dashboard-first approach. Use the **Home** dashboard (`Museum/configs/home.md`) as your primary terminal for:
- Managing the **Terminal Inbox**.
- Tracking **Active Operations**.
- Creating new journals, operations, and wiki entries via automated buttons.

To get started, simply **git clone** this repository and open the folder as a new vault in Obsidian.
